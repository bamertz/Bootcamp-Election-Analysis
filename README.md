# Election-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this election audit analysis project was to add data requested by the election commission. The election commission requested additional data to complete their audit: the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
